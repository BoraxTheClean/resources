## 📃 Idea in brief: Question to be resolved and why

### 💥 Problem

Quarantine measures are not always effective / Several people are not staying at home.

### 👨‍🔬Hypothesis


Using Google Maps automatic location check-in data to assess the effectiveness of quarantine measures across regions.

[This reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fgvlxk/half_of_italians_are_not_staying_home_google_maps/) is an example of this method applied to McDonalds in Italy. Knowing how effective quarantine works in various areas and correlating that with infection rates could potentially be really powerful information.

Build a map like this https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com/en but with testing data (this might be really hard to find), plots that extrapolate into the future, and various methods to estimate the number of actual cases, instead of just reporting the number of confirmed cases.
