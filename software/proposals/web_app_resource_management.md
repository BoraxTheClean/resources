## 📃 Idea in brief: Question to be resolved and why

### 💥 Problem

### 👨‍🔬Hypothesis

To build a web app that allows people to manage and govern resources in their community, such as ventilators, medicine, food, whatever...
The app would function as a platform where "communities" could be created, based on location. The platform would provide functionality for governance and also for posting needs and solutions for the community. This is the basic purpose and functionality of the app, as the project grows new features will be added.

### 🤔 Assumptions

## 💻Implementation Suggestion

### V1

The technology stack would be Node.js for the back-end with MongoDB as a database and React for the front-end. This stack is proposed because it is the one where I (Pedro Filipe) am most comfortable on.

### What it is
(what are we testing and the hypothesis we’re testing)

### What it is not
(what we’re saying no to)

### Design
(Screenshot/drawing/link)

V2 (..repeat the process)
