## 📃 Idea in brief: Question to be resolved and why

### 💥 Problem

In many countries, people rush to supermarkets and end up in lines risking infection.

There is a lack of info about places and services previously used by infected people, governments should be allowed to add tags to the map in order to inform people, they might have had contact with a person known to be infected or with a person with suspicions of infection.

### 👨‍🔬Hypothesis

App with heatmap functionality to recommend routes taking into account the needs of the person and nearby pharmacies and supermarkets. The purpose of the app would be to minimize exposure distributing people as sparsely through the location and through the day.
