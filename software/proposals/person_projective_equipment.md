## 📃 Idea in brief: Question to be resolved and why

### 💥 Problem

Person Projective Equipment documents could definitively use some graphic/UI designers to create designs (icons, social media graphics for multi platform), more user-friendly web copywriting, so it can be ported to the website.  

### 👨‍🔬Hypothesis


It seems like we need to wait until the guide is complete. This could be a great and fun project to do for PPE along with other guides as well. We can export as pdf and to put it on the site for better circulation. Related document: [Full face mask - DIY Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YffY73C3IHYczevvCNnTz48h4jEwEs5xdHKchE6vI6E/edit#heading=h.4ho4f44h0ce7).

Members email reminders.  We have enough members in the signup list that once the “Selected Projects” list reach 4-5 items, we can start asking members if they want to join.  There should be an outline of the required steps in order to make this happen.  Signup → automated github add to project repo → team lead notify → add to JIRA board.

When things get worse in 1-2 weeks, it would be great to have an app specifically for nurses and doctors on the front-line to request items they need for their community and match that with anyone who can help contribute. This could require geolocation, firebase, SPA-type app with ReactJS on the front end. Think Craiglist-but for medical staff to ask for help.
