## 📃 Idea in brief: Question to be resolved and why

### 💥 Problem
Medical staff need to track the positive covid 19 cases and the relationship to places and other persons.

### 👨‍🔬Hypothesis

A mobile app with a graph database (like arangoDB), that doctors can use to store the positive covid19 cases and the relations of that positive cases with places and/or people. In that way they can cross information with other doctors and we can measure the risk of another person being affected by the virus. Graph databases will also be cool because we can use the data very easily on any ML algorithm.  (Integrations like social network connections and mobile location history). 

### 🤔 Assumptions
The assumption is that medical authoroties and/or professional don't have an easy way to track active covid 19 positive cases and an easy way to see the relationship between them.

## 💻Implementation Suggestion
ArangoDB is a document and graph database with an already done api done in javascript (not nodejs)
React native or even web for the front-end.

### V1
Forms and a map and graph interface to track covid 19 positive cases

### What it is
A tracking covid 19 application.

### What it is not
An open to public app that can lead to panic.

### Design

### Data/Experiments

## 💪 Impact of Potential Solution
Track the relationship very quickly

## 🙌 Criteria for Success
