## 📃 Idea in brief: Question to be resolved and why

### 💥 Problem

### 👨‍🔬Hypothesis

A mobile app with a graph database (like arangoDB), that doctors can use to store the positive covid19 cases and the relations of that positive cases with places and/or people. In that way they can cross information with other doctors and we can measure the risk of another person being affected by the virus. Graph databases will also be cool because we can use the data very easily on any ML algorithm.  (Integrations like social network connections and mobile location history).
