## 📃 Idea in brief: Question to be resolved and why

### 💥 Problem

People will want to go places and avoid big crowds. This quarantine is just at the first stage, but soon people will crave to go out for multiple reasons (walk, running, take the dog out...) and most of all avoid getting crazy at home. But there is no system that allows to understand how many people are gathered in a specific place. 

### 👨‍🔬Hypothesis

This could be a Waze-like application where people inform where they are (it could even be anonymous, people just need to know the level of exposure) and for how long.
This will allow people to make decisions on where to go and when and also help police, ambulances and cameras better manage public places and gatherings.
Even if, with the existence of this application, people are not conscious and civil, it could evolve into a ticketing system, where people make reservations.
