# 📃 Idea in brief: Question to be resolved and why

💥 Problem

Since most (if not all) of Europe is on contention/quarantine mode, people tend to stay alone with their families at home, hoarding lots of goods that might lack in other households, such as food or medicine. This creates an unbalance where some have lots of goods that might even get wasted where others don’t have enough. This is especially true for homeless people.

👨‍🔬Hypothesis

Create a web app that allows people to connect by location, creating communities in which they can channel the surplus of resources they might have and increase awareness for problems that might exist in their neighborhoods.

🤔 Assumptions

-   Most people in most neighborhoods have access to the internet;
    
-   People are inherently good and will share resources and help if they know a neighbor is in need.
    

# 💻Implementation Suggestion

V1

Easy to use application that allows people to create “communities” based on location, post needs they might have, govern resource allocation and increase speed in response to issues.

What it is

We are testing if people would adhere to this way of solving nearby necessities and if it would be useful.

What it is not

This is not a social network or a job posting app.

Design

I don’t have yet

  

Data

-   We would need access to:
    

-   Location;
    
-   Name;
    
-   Quarantine Level (if they can move from place to place to help or they are confined to their house);
    

----------

## 💪 Impact of Potential Solution

-   Resources would not go to waste
    
-   Elderly people and homeless people might be signaled more efficiently;
    
-   A sense of community would be built.
    

## 🙌 Criteria for Success

-   App is being used;
    
-   Users are sending feedback, engaging in what they deem as a good solution;
    
-   The ratio between solved and unsolved problems is favorable. Meaning people are using the app and it is doing its purpose.
    

## 😅 Known Issues

-   People not wanting to expose themselves. Either posting problems they might have or offering their own resources/help;
    
-   Reaching out to users might be a problem;
    
-   People “breaking out” of their quarantine too much or infecting people without wanting it.
